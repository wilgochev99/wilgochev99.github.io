The proportions are the same, and given for analysis to understand if there any segments that stand out among the others. The major area of focus is determining cost differences among segments. Segments 
			have been broken out by country, customer & business unit. Additionally, these orders are seen as the front line for our executives. They allocate their time to companies 
			most engaged with our development processes, so I created an interactive flow to help business unit executives navigate where money is being spent on business development to help show this.
